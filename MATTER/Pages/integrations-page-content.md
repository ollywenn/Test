## Integrations

### Connecting the systems your business already depends on

Modern travel businesses run on a patchwork of platforms — reservation systems, CRMs, payment providers, supplier APIs and internal tools.

Integrations are what turn that patchwork into something that actually works.

We design and build integrations that allow systems to exchange data reliably, automate key processes and stay in sync — without introducing fragility or long-term maintenance pain.

## Why integrations matter

### Integration is not a technical detail. It’s an operational advantage.

When systems don’t talk properly, teams compensate with manual work, duplicated effort and workarounds that slowly become business-critical.

Well-designed integrations remove that friction.

They enable real-time availability and pricing, reduce errors, improve reporting accuracy and allow teams to focus on customers rather than administration.

### What good integrations unlock

- Reduced manual effort and fewer operational errors
- Real-time availability, pricing and booking data
- Faster, more reliable customer journeys
- Consistent data across systems and teams
- Better monitoring, reporting and visibility
- Integrations that remain maintainable over time

## Our integrations

### Integration done properly is a strategic advantage

We don’t “wire things together and hope for the best”.

Our integrations are designed with resilience, observability and change in mind — because travel systems evolve, suppliers change, and volume fluctuates.

### Integration categories

**Booking engines**  
Deep integrations with reservation systems to support availability, pricing, booking flows and post-booking activity — without constraining customer experience.

**CRM systems**  
Reliable data flows between bookings, customers and communications, supporting marketing, service and operational reporting.

**Payment gateways**  
Secure, compliant integrations supporting multiple payment methods, providers and transaction models.

**Hotel & flight APIs**  
Supplier integrations designed to cope with rate changes, availability updates and real-world data inconsistencies.

**Customer management systems**  
Operational tools that keep customer data accurate, accessible and actionable across teams.

**Third-party tools**  
Analytics, marketing, content and specialist services integrated cleanly into the wider platform.

## FAQ

### What do integrations mean in a travel technology context?

Integrations allow different systems — booking engines, CRMs, payment providers and supplier APIs — to exchange data reliably and at the right time. In travel, this is essential for availability, pricing, bookings and customer communication.

### Why are integrations so important for travel businesses?

Because travel operations span multiple systems. Without robust integrations, teams rely on manual processes, data becomes inconsistent, and customer experience suffers.

### What systems can Zolv integrate with?

We regularly integrate with reservation systems, CRMs, payment gateways, supplier APIs and third-party tools. Where an API exists — or can be sensibly created — we can usually integrate.

### How do integrations improve customer experience?

By enabling real-time data, smoother booking journeys, faster post-booking processes and fewer errors that spill over into customer service.

### Do you use AI in integrations?

Where it adds value. AI can support enrichment, classification and optimisation — but reliability and correctness always come first.
