## About

### A travel technology partner, not a generic digital agency

We work with travel businesses who need technology to do real work — handle complexity, scale reliably and support the way their teams actually operate.

Zolv exists to bridge the gap between commercial ambition and technical reality in the travel sector. We design, build and support platforms that respect existing systems while unlocking better performance and customer experience.

## Our mission

### Bridging technology and travel — properly

Travel businesses rarely have the luxury of starting again. They inherit systems, suppliers and processes that matter commercially, even when they’re awkward technically.

Our role is to work within that reality — connecting, extending and improving what’s already there, rather than forcing wholesale replacement.

## Our story

### Built in travel, shaped by delivery

**2002**  
Zolv began life building content-managed websites at a time when most digital platforms were static. Early clients included Olympic Holidays and Leeds Chamber of Commerce, setting the foundations for our focus on structured content and scalable systems.

**2003**  
Our client base expanded across travel, recruitment and professional services, sharpening our ability to adapt platforms to different commercial models.

**2004**  
As projects grew in size and complexity, so did the business — moving into larger offices and investing further in platform capability.

Since then, our work has increasingly focused on travel businesses with complex operational requirements — booking systems, integrations, content-heavy journeys and long-term platform evolution.

## What makes us different

### Deep travel experience, end-to-end responsibility

We’re not a generalist agency that occasionally works in travel.

Travel is what we know — from reservation systems and supplier APIs through to post-booking, operations and support.

That experience allows us to take responsibility end-to-end: thinking commercially, designing realistically, building robustly and supporting platforms once they’re live.

Clients work with us because we understand the constraints they’re operating under — and design within them, not around them.

## Meet the founder

### Olly Wenn – Founder & Managing Director

Olly founded Zolv with a focus on building digital platforms that actually survive contact with real users and real businesses.

With over two decades of experience in digital delivery — much of it in travel — he remains closely involved in shaping how Zolv approaches platform design, integration and long-term support.

The emphasis has always been the same: pragmatic decisions, clear trade-offs and technology that earns its keep.

We’re a small, experienced team working on complex travel platforms — not throwaway marketing sites.
