## Insights

### Thinking from inside real travel platforms

We use this space to share what we’re seeing across live projects — the decisions that worked, the ones that didn’t, and the trade-offs most travel teams are quietly dealing with.

It’s not a news feed, and it’s not a thought-leadership exercise.  
It’s practical thinking, shaped by delivery.

## Articles

*(Titles and imagery stay as-is for now; tone is set by the intro above.)*

Each article should implicitly answer at least one of these:

- Why did this matter in a real project?
- What constraint shaped the outcome?
- What would we do differently next time?

That framing will keep future content honest.
