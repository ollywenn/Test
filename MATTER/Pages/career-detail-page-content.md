## Principal Software Engineer / Tech Lead

**Leeds · Full time · Salary £DOE**

## Overview

This is a senior, hands-on role working on complex travel platforms used by real businesses, every day.

You’ll be involved in shaping technical direction, making pragmatic architectural decisions, and leading delivery across projects that integrate with reservation systems, APIs and long-lived platforms.

We’re not looking for someone to “set standards and step back”.  
We’re looking for someone who enjoys doing the work — and taking responsibility for it.

## Responsibilities

- Leading technical delivery across client projects
- Designing and evolving platform architecture in real-world constraints
- Working hands-on with modern .NET, APIs and integrations
- Making clear, defensible technical trade-offs
- Supporting and mentoring other engineers
- Working closely with product, delivery and client stakeholders
- Taking responsibility for platforms once they’re live, not just at launch

You’ll have autonomy, but not isolation. Decisions are discussed, challenged and owned.

## Benefits

We don’t dress this up. What we offer is straightforward and grown-up.

- Competitive salary based on experience
- Sensible working hours
- Flexible working arrangements
- Long-term projects, not constant churn
- A team that values clarity over ego
- The chance to work on platforms that matter to real businesses

If you’re looking for ping-pong tables or novelty perks, this probably isn’t the right place.

## Candidate profile

You’ll likely be a good fit if you:

- Have strong experience with C#, .NET and API-driven systems
- Are comfortable working with legacy and modern systems side-by-side
- Understand the realities of long-lived platforms and integrations
- Can explain *why* a solution makes sense, not just how it works
- Care about maintainability, not just initial delivery
- Are comfortable taking responsibility for decisions

Experience in travel or highly integrated industries is a bonus, but not required.

Good judgement matters more than buzzwords.
