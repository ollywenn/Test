        <h3 class="section-subheading" style="color: white;">A travel technology partner, not a generic digital agency</h3>
        <p class="hero-description">
            We work with travel businesses who need technology to do real work — handle complexity, scale reliably and support the way their teams actually operate.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-description">
            Zolv exists to bridge the gap between commercial ambition and technical reality in the travel sector. We design, build and support platforms 
            that respect existing systems while unlocking better performance and customer experience.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Our mission</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Bridging technology and travel — properly</h3>
        <p class="section-description">
            Travel businesses rarely have the luxury of starting again. They inherit systems, suppliers and processes that matter commercially, 
            even when they're awkward technically.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description">
            Our role is to work within that reality — connecting, extending and improving what's already there, rather than forcing wholesale replacement.

                <h4>2002</h4>
                <p>Zolv began life building content-managed websites at a time when most digital platforms were static. Early clients included Olympic Holidays and Leeds Chamber of Commerce.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>2003</h4>
                <p>Our client base expanded across travel, recruitment and professional services, sharpening our ability to adapt platforms to different commercial models.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>2004</h4>
                <p>As projects grew in size and complexity, so did the business — moving into larger offices and investing further in platform capability.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Present</h4>
                <p>Our work has increasingly focused on travel businesses with complex operational requirements — booking systems, integrations, content-heavy journeys and long-term platform evolution.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">What makes us different</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Deep travel experience, end-to-end responsibility</h3>
        <p>We're not a generalist agency that occasionally works in travel.</p>
        <p>Travel is what we know — from reservation systems and supplier APIs through to post-booking, operations and support.</p>
        <p class="section-description">
            That experience allows us to take responsibility end-to-end: thinking commercially, designing realistically, building robustly and 
            supporting platforms once they're live.

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Olly Wenn – Founder & Managing Director</h3>
        <p>
            Olly founded Zolv with a focus on building digital platforms that actually survive contact with real users and real businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            With over two decades of experience in digital delivery — much of it in travel — he remains closely involved in shaping how Zolv 
            approaches platform design, integration and long-term support.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description">
            The emphasis has always been the same: pragmatic decisions, clear trade-offs and technology that earns its keep.
