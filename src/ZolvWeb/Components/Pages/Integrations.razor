        <p class="hero-description">
            Modern travel businesses run on a patchwork of platforms — reservation systems, CRMs, payment providers, supplier APIs and internal tools.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-description">
            Integrations are what turn that patchwork into something that actually works.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Why integrations matter</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Integration is not a technical detail. It's an operational advantage.</h3>
        <p>
            When systems don't talk properly, teams compensate with manual work, duplicated effort and workarounds that slowly become business-critical.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description">
            Well-designed integrations remove that friction.
