        <p class="hero-description">
            We use this space to share what we're seeing across live projects — the decisions that worked, the ones that didn't, 
            and the trade-offs most travel teams are quietly dealing with.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-description">
            It's not a news feed, and it's not a thought-leadership exercise. It's practical thinking, shaped by delivery.

                <p>Most travel platforms don't fail because of bad ideas. They fail because small, reasonable decisions compound over time.</p>
