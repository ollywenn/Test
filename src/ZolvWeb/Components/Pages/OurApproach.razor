        <h2 class="section-heading" style="color: white;">Our approach</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading" style="color: white;">We partner with travel companies at every stage of their journey</h3>
        <p class="hero-description">
            Travel technology is rarely a clean slate. Most of our clients come to us with existing platforms, suppliers and internal constraints — 
            and that's exactly where we're most effective.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-description">
            We adapt how we work to match your needs, your maturity and your ambitions, while keeping delivery grounded and practical.
